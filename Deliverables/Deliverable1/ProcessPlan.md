# Process Plan Document â€“ Team 22

## 1 Introduction
This product, named TODO On the Go, is an android application that will provide an interactive to do list supporting multiple users.

### 1.1 Definitions and Acronyms
We do not use any non-standard terms or acronyms.

## 2 Process Description

### 2.1 Project Lifecycle
We will use the Evolutionary Prototyping method, deviating only for our initial prototype. Due to the client's requirement that the first version of the prototype be supplied along with the requirements and process plan documents in a very short time period, we are combining the initial concept and initial prototype steps into one. We are also using a UI mock-up instead of a prototype which can be iterated upon due to the time constraint.

### 2.2 Process Activities
#### Initial Concept and Initial Prototype
We will define the initial concept of the product, with its requirements and objectives. This initial concept will be based on the requirements originally provided by the client. We will also design an initial UI mockup using the Pencil Project GUI Mockup Tool to submit to the client for feedback.
* Entrance criteria: The client has a concept.
* Exit criteria: We have formally defined the requirements and developed a UI mockup, and both the team and the client have signed off on those documents.

#### Implement Initial Android Prototype
We will design and implement an initial prototype of the application based on the requirements and UI mockup we defined in the first activity, taking into account client feedback.
* Entrance criteria: The requirements have been formally defined and the client has provided feedback on the requirements document and UI mockup.
* Exit criteria: An initial Android prototype has been developed.

#### Refine Prototype Until Acceptable
We will refine the prototype until it completely satisfies all of the requirements.
* Entrance Criteria: An initial Android prototype has been developed.
* Exit Criteria: The Android application completely satisfies all of the requirements.

#### Complete and Release Prototype
We will execute the test plan to ensure that all requirements are satisfied, package the application and release it to the client
* Entrance Criteria: The application completely satisfies all of the requirements.
* Exit Criteria: The application has been delivered to the client.
