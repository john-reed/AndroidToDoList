## 2 Process used
The project utilized the Prototyping model as per the assignment needs. Unlike the waterfall model we used in Project 1, in this project, we know the basic requirements, but we don't know what exactly the clients want.  It's possible that the client doesn't know what they are expecting either. Thus, we need to present a prototype to the clients and get feedback at the beginning of the development process. In addition, the prototyping model allows us to more accurately estimate the working timeline and monitor the implementation processes. It is important for us to break down specific assignment for each team member and make sure each step can be finished on time. Considering these characteristics, the Prototyping model suited well for this to-do list project.


## 3 Activity assessment: 

3.1 Initial Concept and Initial Prototype

Quality of the deliverable: 95

This activity produced the Process Plan, Requirements Document, and an initial prototype.  

The Process Plan provides an overview of the project and details about the development life-cycle, activities and schedule.  The plan also assigns roles and responsibilities to each team member.  The plan is clear and easy to follow. However, due to members dropping out the course during the development and merging with new teams, the total actual development/test hours significantly exceeded the original estimates in the plan. Therefore 5 points were deducted.   

The Requirements Document analyzed the clientâ€™s needs and requirements in detail.  It specifies what the ToDoOnTheGo app should accomplish and served well as the foundation for the rest of the software development process.   

The initial Prototype is a UI mockup generated using the Pencil tool.  It covered all the essential functions as specified in the Requirements Document, and served well for the purpose of getting feedback from the client.   

3.2 Implement Initial Android Prototype

Quality of the deliverable: 98

This activity produced the Design document, Acceptance test plan, and also revised the Process plan, Requirements document, and prototype according to the client's feedback.   

The Design Document provides an architectural view of the app and keeps the implementation on track to meet all the requirements.  It also contains Class, Sequence and Component diagrams which guided the coding process well.  The Acceptance test plan is thorough. It listed 9 unit test cases and 14 system test cases which covered all the functional requirements.  Although for better visualbility, a traceability matrix should be created to ensure that the test cases matches the requirements mentioned in the Requirements document. Thus 2 points were deducted.  After obtained client's feedback, the Requirements document and prototype is properly modified and fits client's requirement better.  There is little change with the Process plan. 

3.3 Refine Prototype Until Acceptable 

Quality of the deliverable: 85

This activity produced the alpha/beta release of the app and the Acceptance test plan with results. 

The alpha/beta release of the app satisfies all the client requirements. The logic of the code is straightforward.  Classes of different activities, models and dialogs are well-organized.  Naming of the objects is self-explanatory.  Sufficient comments are provided.  5 points were deducted from the implementation since the appearance of UI screens looks a little rough.  Because the tester dropped the course at last phase of this activity, the unit test cases were left undone at Deliverable 3.  Therefore 10 points were deducted.         
   

3.4 Complete and Release Prototype

Quality of the deliverable: 97

This activity produced the final release of the ToDoOnTheGo app, User documentation and revised Acceptance test plan.

The final app satisfies all the requirements.  Compared to the beta release, the final version fixed three bugs, added new features and improved the appearance of the user interface.  3 points were deducted from the source code because the UI can be further improved.  The User documentation provides clear instructions on how to use the app with easy-to-follow screen shots.  In this activity, new tester joined the team and completed the unit testing code. Thorough testing was performed again according to the test plan and all system test cases were passed.    


## 4 Productivity assessment
* Total time spent: 50 hours
* Total lines of code in delivered product: 2561
* Total lines of user documentation: 102
* Productivity score: 95
* Rationale for score: we completed the project on time going through unexpected interruptions of two team members dropping the course and subsequently merging with a new team.  The end product is fully functional and was validated to meet all the client expectations.  Due to under-estimation of the development effort and interruptions of team rearrangement, the actual hours spent were significantly more than the initial estimation in the Process plan.  For example, 17 hours were spent on testing while only 8 hours were planned. Thus, 5 points were deducted.   

## 5 Quality assessment
* Total number of test cases: 14
* Total number of defects found during testing: 0
* Total number of defects fixed: 0
* Quality score: 98
* Rationale for score: the final release of the ToDoOnTheGo app was thoroughly tested and it fulfilled all the client's requirements.  2 points were deducted because one defect was identified during the testing of the beta release. The defect was fixed in the final release.
   - Sign out: user can sign out by hitting back button but sign out is not confirmed.

## 6 Recommendations:

6.1 We spent a whole week working on the prototype while only have 2-3 weeks left for the implementation and testing. Some of the functions we proposed in the prototype were not implemented or even considered later on. We should have designed a much simpler prototype and save more time for improvement in the later phase before the final release of our product.

6.2 There is possibly a little too much involvement from the clients and it is not always agreed by the developers (but we did it anyway as a practice). For example, as an application used on an android phone, it is not very necessary to have multiple users and a password-protected login interface, as a cell phone is a personal device and usually already has a login protection.

6.3 It will be very helpful if we can present the clients a second prototype after revision of the first one before implementation. This is to make sure that all the requirements are well-understood and to lower the risk of wasting development efforts.



## 7 Summary:
Following the Prototyping process model, we developed an app called ToDoOnTheGo which is capable of managing personal to-do list on an android phone.  The development process has five main phases: analyzing client's requirements, prototype design, prototype revision after client feedback, implementation and testing.  Most of the activities have been completed as planned and on schedule, except the delay of submitting unit test results in Deliverable3 due to the tester dropping out the course.  The final release was thoroughly tested and validated to meet all the requirements.  Communication between team members during the whole process was effective.  Google hangout and emails were used during each phase to review documents and discuss issues.  This ensured tasks were properly assigned and each product met the expectation of every team member involved.  Due to time limitations, some functions will be implemented in future releases, such as be able to choose personalized pictures for each user, be able to rank tasks based on due date or priority, and be able to set up automatic reminder for reoccurring tasks.
